# Markdown to HTML Parser in Rust

A simple, lightweight library for converting Markdown to HTML, written in pure, safe Rust. This project aims to provide a straightforward and easy-to-use package for your Rust applications

## ‚ú® Features

Currently, the following Markdown syntax is supported:

- [x] Headings (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.)
- [x] Bold text (`**text**`)
- [x] Italic text (`*text*`)
- [x] Links (`[display text](url)`)
- [x] Unordered Lists (`- list item`)
- [x] Code Blocks  (`- codeblock item`)

## üì¶ Installation

To use `mark-html` in your project, you can add it to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
mark-html = "0.2.0"
```

Alternatively, you can use the `cargo add` command:

```sh
cargo add mark-html
```

## üöÄ Usage

Once the crate is added to your project, you can use the `to_html` function in your code:

```rust
// main.rs
extern crate mark-html;

fn main() {
    let markdown = "## Hello, World!\n\nThis is a **test** of our *new* parser.\n\n- Item 1\n- Item 2";
    let html = mark-html::to_html(markdown);
    println!("{}", html);
}
```

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The conversion process happens in three main stages:

1.  **Lexing**: The input Markdown string is scanned and broken down into a sequence of "tokens". For example, `**hello**` becomes `[BoldStart, Text("hello"), BoldEnd]`.
2.  **Parsing**: The sequence of tokens is converted into a hierarchical structure called an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). This tree represents the document's structure (e.g., a paragraph containing bold text).
3.  **Rendering**: The AST is traversed, and for each node in the tree, the corresponding HTML is generated.

## What's New in 0.2.0

*   Added support for code blocks.

## Examples

Here are a few examples of the conversion in action.

**Input:**
````markdown
# Main Title

This is a paragraph with **bold** and *italic* text. Here is a [link to GitHub](https://github.com/Shivrajsoni).

- First list item
- Second list item
````

**Output:**
```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph with <strong>bold</strong> and <em>italic</em> text. Here is a <a href="https://github.com">link to GitHub</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>First list item</li>
<li>Second list item</li>
</ul>
```
