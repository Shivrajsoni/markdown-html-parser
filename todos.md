# Future Plans & Roadmap

This document outlines the future plans for this Markdown-to-HTML parser library. The primary goal is learning, with the ambition of creating a robust, production-ready Rust library that can eventually parse MDX and power a web-based conversion tool.

## ðŸŽ¯ Short-Term Goals: Core Markdown Features

These are the next practical steps to build a complete and compliant Markdown parser.

- [ ] **Inline Code:** Support for `inline code snippets`.
- [ ] **Image Tags:** Implement the `![alt text](url)` syntax.
- [ ] **Blockquotes:** Support for `> quoted text`.
- [ ] **Ordered Lists:** Implement numbered lists, e.g., `1. First item`.
- [ ] **Fenced Code Blocks:** Support for multi-line code blocks using triple backticks (```), with optional language highlighting.
- [ ] **Horizontal Rules:** Implement rules using `---` or `***`.
- [ ] **Character Escaping:** Correctly handle escaped characters, like `\*` rendering as a literal asterisk.
